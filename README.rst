Generative Recurrent Neural Networks
====================================

This package implements the Generative Recurrent Neural Networks from the `paper
<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/minf.201700111>`_  from Gupta et al. and combines it with the Reinforcement Learning procedures described in the `paper <https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13321-017-0235-x>`_ from Olivecrona et al.

Installation
------------

In order to use this package, you need the following packages installed:

- scikit-learn (0.19.1 or higher)
- tensorflow (1.9.0 or higher) or tensorflow-gpu (1.9.0 or higher)
- keras (2.2.0 or higher)
- rdkit (optional)

RDkit is only needed for the reward function in reinforcement learning.

To install, start by cloning the repository:

``https://github.com/SilviaAmAm/MolBot.git``

Then:

``pip install MolBot/``
