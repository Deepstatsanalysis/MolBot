Generative Recurrent Neural Networks
====================================

This package implements the Generative Recurrent Neural Networks from the `paper
<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/minf.201700111>`_  from Gupta et al. and combines it with the Reinforcement Learning procedures described in the `paper <https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13321-017-0235-x>`_ from Olivecrona et al.
